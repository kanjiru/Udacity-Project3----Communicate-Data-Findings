# Udacity-Project3----Communicate-Data-Findings
#Project Overview
This project demonstrates the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process.

* Part I, Exploratory data visualization, I will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.

* Part II, Explanatory data visualization, I will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in my dataset. I will be transforming my exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.

## Dataset

> The selected data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.The data features include duration (secs) and others such as DateTime, customer type, start and end station name, start and end station longitude and latitude, among others.


## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I found out that the average duration for all trips is about 500 seconds. Most of the rides (>80) were taken by subscribers and above 70% of the total rides were taken by the male gender.
Also  customers spend much more duration on their trips than subscribers and females tend to ride for more duration than males.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> There is a relationship between bikes ride count and duration ot the rides between user_types i.e Customers, Subscribers

> There are also stations with most trips ie Market St ad San Francisco Caltrain Station2 and Embarcadero at Sansome with the least amount of trips.
